-health bar
-centered canvas
-made a new heart.js

### Day 2

Plan for the day:
-Enemies (+ their movement)!!!!! ✅
    -different sprites for the enemy when it moves ❌
-Make shuriken throwing mechanic (when they touch enemies, they die) ❌
    -different sprite for when the player shoots the shuriken ❌
-Make damage mechanic (when player touches enemies, health--) ✅
    -Player blinks red when come in touch with enemies OR the canvas becomes red for a second? ❌
    -When health reaches 0, level starts anew???!!!!!! ❌


### For the coming days
