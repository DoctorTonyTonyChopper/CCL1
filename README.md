# üéÆ **Game Title** 

> **Short Pitch**: Infiltrate the facility where your body is held and try to retrieve it! In this retro-inspired jump and run platformer, obstacles like spikes and robot and drone enemies await you with the sole purpose to stop you. Collect hearts to earn health and shuriken to stock up on ammo to defy your enemies and kill them.

## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme and style came together seamlessly, and the sprites were fun to design.
- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity-based gameplay worked better than expected and provided a unique challenge.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Implementing all the features we envisioned wasn‚Äôt possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
